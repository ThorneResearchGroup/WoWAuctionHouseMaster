# WoWAuctionHouseMaster (WAHM)
WAHM is a website that helps you view the World of Warcraft auction house outside the game. Using the official Blizzard World of Warcraft Auction House API, the site loads in the data, graphs it over periods of time.

This was created as an excersise in importing JSON data to a database, generating a web UI using the data, CRON type executions, graphing, search functionality and eventually LUA (addon).
